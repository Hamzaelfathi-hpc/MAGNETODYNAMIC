A Fortran solver for the magnetodynamic equation on the magnetic vector potential within the quasi-static approximation.

Details of the numerical method are provided in the accompanying NUMERICAL_METHODS document.

I am currently working on implementing a Newtonâ€“Raphson iteration loop to handle nonlinear magnetic permeability (nonlinear with respect to B, not spatially) for applications in ferromagnetic materials.
